## Ibali Omeka-S How To

This is a general guide for developing a showcase site on Ibali, through Omeka S and IIIF platforms. In order to create any kind of site, users are required to create items with appropriate descriptions. These items can be interlinked with one another as well as other data on the internet.
Building a collection like this will require some curation and all users are requested to meet with DLS staff for a curation session in order to prepare the items for showcasing. This is only for Omeka-S. Another test.
