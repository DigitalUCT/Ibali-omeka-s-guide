## Ibali Omeka-S How To

This is a general guide for developing a showcase site on Ibali, through Omeka S and IIIF platforms. In order to create any kind of site, users are required to create items with appropriate descriptions. These items can be interlinked with one another as well as other data on the internet.
Building a collection like this will require some curation and all users are requested to meet with DLS staff for a curation session in order to prepare the items for showcasing. This is only for Omeka-S. Another test.

Here are some of the questions you should consider answering in order to assist with the creation of your collection and site:
1. What kind of items do you have in your collection?
2. What other kind of “items” are referred to by the media items in your collection?
3. How do the items interrelate?
4. For each of the media items, what is the current metadata that you have?
5. How would you describe the non-media items?
6. How would you group your collections of items in terms of where/how they come from?
7. Can you consolidate your keyword list to link between items?
8. Describe how you would want your site to work?
